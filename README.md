# Full-Stack React Playground

This repo contains a full-stack application with an express backend and a React frontend. It's a simple application to showcase state management, functional components, and conditional rendering.

It uses Vite as the module bundler and dotenv for configuration. It's organized as a mono-repo using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) which allows us to have our client and server in one repo.

> **Note**: When you run `npm install` at the root, it will install all dependencies listed in `package.json`, `server/package.json`, and `client/package.json`.

## This playground contains:

1. A light switch guessing game. See how many tries it takes you to get all the switches to stay on.
2. A simple memory game. See how many tries it takes you to get all the matches.
3. A  new game that I haven't thougt about yet...
4. Update `./server/migration.sql` to the schema for your application.

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Create your database: `createdb YOUR_DB`
1. Run your migrations: `psql -f server/migration.sql YOUR_DB`
1. Create your `.env` file: `cp .env.template .env`
1. Add your info in `.env`
1. Run the app: `npm run dev`
